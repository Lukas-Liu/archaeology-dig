# Archaeology Dig Simulator
Welcome to the **Archaeology Dig Simulator**, a fun and interactive js app Lukas has prototyped where you can simulate digging into a 3D grid to uncover hidden artifacts!

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- **Interactive Digging Grid**: Start exploring a 3x3x3 grid and dig layer by layer to uncover hidden artifacts. (This area will be expanded later...)
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Receive instant feedback in the
- **Digging Log** as you uncover artifacts or dig into empty spaces.
- **Reset Functionality**: Easily reset the grid and start a new simulation with the click of a button.
- **Expandable Grid**: The current prototype is a 3x3x3 space, but the design is flexible and can be expanded to larger grids in future versions.
- **Action Point**: This current version allows a five-day excavation and you can only dig 3 times a day. You will not be able to dug up the entire trench!
