# Archaeology Dig Simulator

Welcome to the **Archaeology Dig Simulator**, a fun and interactive js app Lukas has prototyped where you can simulate digging into a 3D grid to uncover hidden artifacts!

# Tech Specs
This project uses of React to create an engaging and responsive user interface. The coding is primarily done with talking to GPT-4o.

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Interactive Digging Grid**: Start exploring a 3x3x3 grid and dig layer by layer to uncover hidden artifacts. (This area will be expanded later...)
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Receive instant feedback in the **Digging Log** as you uncover artifacts or dig into empty spaces.
- **Reset Functionality**: Easily reset the grid and start a new simulation with the click of a button.
- **Expandable Grid**: The current prototype is a 3x3x3 space, but the design is flexible and can be expanded to larger grids in future versions.
